The AI-Powered Health Assistant is a modern AI application that leverages Google‚Äôs Generative AI (Gemini) models, specifically gemini-2.5-flash-lite, to provide medical assistance and interactive healthcare support. The system answers health-related queries, provides medical insights, and facilitates services such as appointment scheduling in a user-friendly interface.

The project is built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive Chatbot interface. The assistant uses Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite through the Google Generative AI API to process natural language queries, analyze symptoms, and generate context-aware medical responses. The system also recognizes keywords like ‚Äúappointment‚Äù to guide users through appointment-related functionalities.

Key results show that the Chatbot delivers accurate, coherent, and informative responses, enhancing healthcare accessibility and engagement.
