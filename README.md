</p>

The **AI-Powered Health Assistant** is a cutting-edge application that leverages artificial intelligence to provide medical assistance and user-friendly healthcare interactions. This project utilizes the **Falcon-7B-Instruct** model from Hugging Face, a powerful instruction-based large language model (LLM), to deliver accurate and context-aware medical responses. The system is designed to answer health-related queries and facilitate medical services such as appointment scheduling.

The project is built with **Streamlit**, offering an intuitive and interactive Chatbot interface that ensures a seamless user experience. The methodology includes model integration using **Hugging Face APIs** and dynamic conversation handling. The Chatbot is capable of processing natural language queries, analyzing symptoms, providing health-related insights, and responding appropriately to user prompts. Additionally, the assistant recognizes specific keywords like "appointment" and facilitates appointment booking functionalities by displaying relevant messages or guidance.

Key results from testing show that the **Falcon-7B-Instruct** model effectively generates relevant, informative, and coherent medical responses, making the AI-powered Chatbot a valuable tool for healthcare accessibility. The appointment scheduling feature further enhances user engagement, providing a personalized and interactive healthcare assistant experience.
